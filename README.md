# Words extractor script

This script extracts words of a specified length from a dictionary file and saves them to a new text file.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that Python (preferably the latest version) is installed.
- Sample dictionary file ("dict.txt") with words separated by spaces or newlines. You can download it [here](dict.txt) or find it in the same repository as this script.

## Usage

### To run the script, use a command-line interface such as Bash or Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located. 
__Run the following command:__

```
python words_extractor.py
```
Enter the desired word length when prompted.

Check the output in the __txt files__ folder. The results will be saved in a file named __{length}-letter-words.txt__.

## Example

How long should the words be in letters?
Type in the number >> 7

The script generates a file named __7-letter-words.txt__ containing words from the dictionary with a length of 7 letters.

## Important notes

Ensure the presence of a dictionary file **dict.txt** in the same directory as the script.
The output folder **txt files** will be created if it doesn't exist.
